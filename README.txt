  I'd like to help out with this module, specifically developing a backport to D5 version.
  I'm interesting to be a co-mantainer of this module.

Branching and putting files in cvs was done by schildi, who NOT attempts be be the co-maintainer of this module but support developers a bit.

Hopefully elpepeuy can be "reactivated" to continue work on this module.
