This initial backport of module search_files was done by elpepeuy.

  I'd like to help out with this module, specifically developing a backport to D5 version.
  I'm interesting to be a co-mantainer of this module.

Branching and putting files in cvs was done by schildi, who NOT attempts be be the co-maintainer of this module but support developers a bit.

Hopefully elpepeuy can be "reactivated" to continue work on this module. 


A get more in sync with current development a patch (see http://drupal.org/node/285834 #3) was applied which brings up the actual code to be as close as possible to current revision 1.19 of D6. That is the last one before merging with search_attachment starts.
